# Open Problems in Category Theory
This repository is meant as a single place to collect open problems in category theory. I plan to eventually add these to [Clowder, Tag 01V9](https://www.clowderproject.com/tag/01V9.html), maybe implementing also some extra infrastructure for ease of use, like tags.

The ordering of the problems is currently arbitrary, though this may change in the future to improve the usability of this list.

## Suggesting Problems
Is there an open problem in category theory which you would like to have listed here? If so, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/The-Clowder-Project/Open-Problems-in-Category-Theory/issues/new) detailing the problem, or alternatively contact the project maintainer at [emily.de.oliveira.santos.tmf@gmail.com](mailto:emily.de.oliveira.santos.tmf@gmail.com).

All suggestions are extremely welcome!

## Current Problems

### Monoidal Categories

#### 0000. Are dualizable topological vector spaces finite-dimensional? (Dmitri Pavlov, [MO 471619](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/471619))
Let TVS be the symmetric monoidal category of complete Hausdorff topological vector spaces equipped with the completed projective, injective, or inductive tensor product.

If VâˆˆObj(TVS) is dualizable, must dim(V) be finite?

#### 0001. Is a monoidal category such that every object is a counital comagma in a unique way necessarily a Cartesian monoidal category? (Jean-Baptiste Vienney, via [Zulip](https://categorytheory.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/241990-community.3A-discussion/topic/Open.20problems.20in.20category.20theory/near/483975926))

> **Jean-Baptiste Vienney:** The reason why I think it is interesting is that the answer is "yes" if we replace "monoidal" by "symmetric monoidal" but the proof makes essential use of the symmetry. On the other hand, I don't know how to find any counterexample without the symmetry.

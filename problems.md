**Description:**

Let TVS be the symmetric monoidal category of complete Hausdorff topological vector spaces equipped with the completed projective, injective, or inductive tensor product.

 If VâˆˆObj(TVS) is dualizable, must dim(V) be finite?

**Description:**

*Jean-Baptiste Vienney:* The reason why I think it is interesting is that the answer is "yes" if we replace "monoidal" by "symmetric monoidal" but the proof makes essential use of the symmetry. On the other hand, I don't know how to find any counterexample without the symmetry

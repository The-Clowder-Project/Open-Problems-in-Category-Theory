## Are dualizable topological vector spaces finite-dimensional?

**Tag:** `0001`

**Author:** Dmitri Pavlov

**Link:** [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/471619](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/471619)

**Description:**

Let TVS be the symmetric monoidal category of complete Hausdorff topological vector spaces equipped with the completed projective, injective, or inductive tensor product.

 If V∈Obj(TVS) is dualizable, must dim(V) be finite?

## Is a monoidal category such that every object is a counital comagma in a unique way necessarily a Cartesian monoidal category?

**Tag:** `0002`

**Description:**

**Jean-Baptiste Vienney:** The reason why I think it is interesting is that the answer is "yes" if we replace "monoidal" by "symmetric monoidal" but the proof makes essential use of the symmetry. On the other hand, I don't know how to find any counterexample without the symmetry

## Generalized polycategories as monoids in a double-Kleisli virtual double category constructed from two VDC monads and a horizontal distributive law

**Tag:** `0003`

**Description:**

**Michael Shulman:** there should be a construction of a double-Kleisli virtual double category from two VDC monads and a horizontal distributive law, in which monoids are a notion of "generalized polycategory".

## Characterizing limits of diagrams consisting of both lax and oplax morphisms of algebras | F-categories

**Tag:** `0005`

**Author:** Michael Shulman

**Link:** [https://categorytheory.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/241990-community.3A-discussion/topic/Open.20problems.20in.20category.20theory/near/483993203](https://categorytheory.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/241990-community.3A-discussion/topic/Open.20problems.20in.20category.20theory/near/483993203)

**Description:**

**Michael Shulman:** Steve Lack and I formulated a context of F-categories in which we could exactly characterize the 2-dimensional limits of diagrams consisting of strict and lax morphisms for algebras over a 2-monad that can be lifted from the base category. There's a dual version for strict and oplax morphisms. But is there a context of this sort that includes both lax and oplax morphisms? There are limits of that sort that do lift, e.g. the comma object of an oplax morphism over a lax one. But (it seems that) you can't compose a lax morphism with an oplax one to get anything interesting, so it's unclear whether there's some kind of "enhanced 2-category" that includes them both. There is a double category of lax and oplax morphisms, but is there a kind of limit in double categories that would capture this?

## Beta/eta equality for as equational theories induced by interpretations of bicartesian-closed categories that aren't preorders

**Tag:** `0006`

**Author:** Alex Simpson

**Link:** [https://tlca.di.unito.it/opltlca/opltlcasu22.html#x27-40000](https://tlca.di.unito.it/opltlca/opltlcasu22.html#x27-40000)

**Description:**

given any bicartesian-closed category CC that is not a preorder, the equational theory induced by all interpretations [of the typed lambda calculus with finite sums and products] in CC is exactly beta/eta equality.

## Is there a conceptual definition of rig category recovering Laplaza's definition?

**Tag:** `0007`

**Author:** John Baez

**Link:** [https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/splitting/splitting_web.pdf](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/splitting/splitting_web.pdf)

**Description:**

A possible approach would be constructing a tensor product of symmetric monoidal categories, following e.g. [arXiv:2211.04464](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04464), and checking whether pseudomonoids with respect to that tensor product recover rig categories in the sense of Laplaza.

## A more general splitting principle for 2-rigs

**Tag:** `0009`

**Author:** John Baez, Joe Moller, and Todd Trimble

**Link:** [https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2410.05598#page=35](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2410.05598#page=35)

**Description:**

Let R be a 2-rig and r ∈ R an object of finite bosonic subdimension. Then there exists a 2-rig R' and a map of 2-rigs E: R → R' such that:
1. E(r) splits as a direct sum of finitely many bosonic subline objects.
2. E: R → R' is a 2-rig extension, i.e., it is faithful, conservative, and essentially injective.
3. K(E): K(R) → K(R') is injective.

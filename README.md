# Open Problems in Category Theory
This repository is meant as a single place to collect open problems in category theory. I plan to eventually add these to [Clowder, Tag 01V9](https://www.clowderproject.com/tag/01V9.html), maybe implementing also some extra infrastructure for ease of use, like tags.

The ordering of the problems is currently arbitrary, though this may change in the future to improve the usability of this list.

## Suggesting Problems
Is there an open problem in category theory which you would like to have listed here? If so, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/The-Clowder-Project/Open-Problems-in-Category-Theory/issues/new) detailing the problem, or alternatively contact the project maintainer at [emily.de.oliveira.santos.tmf@gmail.com](mailto:emily.de.oliveira.santos.tmf@gmail.com).

All suggestions are extremely welcome!

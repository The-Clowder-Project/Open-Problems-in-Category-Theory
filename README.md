# Open Problems in Category Theory
This repository is meant as a single place to collect open problems in category theory. I plan to eventually add these to [Clowder, Tag 01V9](https://www.clowderproject.com/tag/01V9.html), maybe implementing also some extra infrastructure for ease of use, like tags.

## Suggesting Problems
Is there an open problem in category theory which you would like to have listed here? If so, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/The-Clowder-Project/Open-Problems-in-Category-Theory/issues/new) detailing the problem, or alternatively contact the project maintainer at [emily.de.oliveira.santos.tmf@gmail.com](mailto:emily.de.oliveira.santos.tmf@gmail.com).

All suggestions are extremely welcome!

## Current Problems
### Monoidal Categories

#### 01. Are dualizable topological vector spaces finite-dimensional? (Dmitri Pavlov, [MO 471619](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/471619))
Let TVS be the symmetric monoidal category of complete Hausdorff topological vector spaces equipped with the completed projective, injective, or inductive tensor product.

If VâˆˆObj(TVS) is dualizable, must dim(V) be finite?
